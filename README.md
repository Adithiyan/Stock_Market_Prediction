Prediction of stock price/performance using Numerical and Textual Analysis

Objective - to create a hybrid model for stock price/performance prediction using numerical analysis of historical stock prices, and sentimental analysis of news headlines.

Dataset - LT stock data from Yahoo Finance
Textual News data from https://bit.ly/36fFPI6.

Conclusion:
Six different Neural Network models were used to carry out the analysis and prediction of stock price/performance, trained with Hybrid data generated from Numerical data (i.e. Stock price history of L&T) and Textual data (i.e.India News Headlines data).
